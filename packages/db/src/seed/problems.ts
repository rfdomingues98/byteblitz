Given an array of integers \`nums\` and an integer \`target\`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to \`target\`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

## Example 1:

\`\`\`
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
\`\`\`

## Example 2:

\`\`\`
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
\`\`\`

## Example 3:

\`\`\`
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]

## Constraints:

- \`2 <= nums.length <= 10^4\`
- \`-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9\`
- \`-10^9 <= target <= 10^9\`

Given a string \`s\` containing just the characters \`'('\`, \`')'\`, \`'{'\`, \`'}'\`, \`'['\` and \`']'\`, determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
3. Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.
